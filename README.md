## algorithm for shortest path

- Using Warnsdorff's rule, we number each chess cell based on the knight's move (knight tour algo).
- With each cell numbered, based on the ending cell input, we go cell by cell but the cells must be lower than the ending cell number and each cell should gradually get to the numbered cell.
- Exemple: ![Image of the algorithm](src/assets/algoForKnightTravails.png 'Algorithm for finding the shortest path')
