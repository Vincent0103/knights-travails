# Knight Travails

This web project finds the shortest path a knight can make on a chess board from a point A to a point B, the points are entirely choosable by the user via an UI. If you want even further explanation of the path taken, go to dev tools console.

## Algorithm used

graph BFS

### Notes

This was really hard to find out which algorithm i had to use for this case, i first thought of using Warnsdorff's rule for a knight tour then use my own algorithm to find out but it turned out to be very very complicated and i was stuck for like a couple days finding the right algorithm. After watching a couple of videos and ressources about which algorithm i had to use, BFS came to be the best solution. I really thought i would skip this project but everything is possible if you spend a lot of efforts, perseverance and dedication onto it. Get the right programmer mentality and you're eyes won't deceive!
